# AI LIBRARY - Infinite Canvas Mindmap Design

## Selected Design: Cosmic Neural Network

### Design Movement
**Neo-Futurism meets Data Visualization** - A living, breathing network of interconnected nodes that feels like exploring a neural network or constellation map. The interface should feel like you're navigating through space, discovering AI tools as stars in a vast galaxy.

### Core Principles
1. **Infinite Exploration** - No boundaries, endless canvas that invites discovery
2. **Organic Connections** - Flowing lines and curves connect related tools and categories
3. **Depth Through Scale** - Zoom reveals more detail, from galaxy view to individual stars
4. **Living Interface** - Subtle animations make the canvas feel alive and responsive

### Color Philosophy
- **Deep Space Background**: Near-black (#050510) with subtle blue/purple nebula gradients
- **Category Nodes**: Each category has a distinct glow color
  - AI Assistants: Violet (#8B5CF6)
  - Code & Dev: Blue (#3B82F6)
  - Image & Art: Pink (#EC4899)
  - Video: Amber (#F59E0B)
  - Audio: Emerald (#10B981)
  - Writing: Indigo (#6366F1)
  - Research: Teal (#14B8A6)
  - Productivity: Orange (#F97316)
  - Business: Red (#EF4444)
- **Connection Lines**: Gradient lines that pulse with energy
- **Tool Nodes**: Bright, luminous points that glow when hovered
- **Featured Tools**: Golden/amber glow to stand out
- **Hidden Gems**: Sparkle effect with amber/gold accents

### Layout Paradigm
- **Central Hub**: AI LIBRARY logo at center, categories radiate outward
- **Orbital Arrangement**: Categories arranged in a circular pattern around center
- **Cluster Formation**: Tools cluster around their category/subcategory nodes
- **Zoom Levels**:
  - Level 1 (Galaxy): See all categories as glowing orbs
  - Level 2 (Constellation): See subcategories branching from categories
  - Level 3 (Star System): See individual tools with names
  - Level 4 (Planet): Full tool card with description, pricing, links

### Signature Elements
1. **Pulsing Connection Lines**: Animated gradients flowing between related nodes
2. **Glow Halos**: Nodes have soft, colored halos that intensify on hover
3. **Minimap**: Small overview map in corner for navigation
4. **Search Spotlight**: Search highlights matching nodes with spotlight effect

### Interaction Philosophy
- **Pan**: Click and drag to explore the canvas
- **Zoom**: Scroll wheel or pinch to zoom in/out
- **Click Node**: Expand to show children or open tool details
- **Double-click**: Quick zoom to node
- **Search**: Real-time filtering with visual highlighting

### Animation Guidelines
- **Entrance**: Nodes fade in with scale animation when canvas loads
- **Hover**: Gentle pulse and glow intensification (200ms)
- **Expand**: Smooth spring animation for children appearing
- **Zoom**: Fluid easing with momentum
- **Connections**: Subtle gradient animation along lines

### Typography System
- **Logo/Title**: Space Grotesk - Bold, geometric, futuristic
- **Category Names**: Inter - Semi-bold, clean readability
- **Tool Names**: Inter - Medium weight
- **Descriptions**: Inter - Regular, smaller size

### Technical Stack
- React Flow (@xyflow/react) for infinite canvas
- Custom node components for categories, subcategories, tools
- Custom edge components for animated connections
- CSS animations for performance
- Responsive controls for mobile
